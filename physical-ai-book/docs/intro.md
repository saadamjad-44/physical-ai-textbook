Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This textbook will guide you through the journey of bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces (like chatbots or recommendation engines), Physical AI is embodied in robots that can move, perceive, and interact with the real world.

## Course Goals

- **Bridge the Gap**: Connect digital brains with physical bodies.
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Apply AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots.
- **Real-world Application**: Use industry-standard tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Modules Overview

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Middleware for robot control.
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Physics simulation and environment building.
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Advanced perception and training.
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Convergence of LLMs and Robotics.

Let's begin our journey into the future of work!
